    <p>Hello, My name is Ahmad Dias. 
        Im writing this information that your reading on a HP laptop outside on UWIs bench in the cold at 8:36PM.
        Im waitiing on my ride to finish class, he's wasting time getting educated honestly,imagine a friend of mine just passed,didnt recognize her , thats crazy.
        The headache I have right now is insane, I didnt get enough water or anything to eat really.
    </p>
    <p>This paragraph is being written on another day, I just woke up ,its very cold, but I have to submit this in time.
        I tried using CHATGBT to write a paragraph about myself , but they didnt have any information about myself to write,clearly the technology isnt as advanced as they claim.
        I suppose you could argue "why not copy,paste some random paragraph?".
        The answer to that is,because it quite boring, writing something dynamic and interesting is more interestings.
        I supposed Ive rambled enough,probable reading this like "murder he can chat!",Yes, your right.
